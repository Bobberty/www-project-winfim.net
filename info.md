### WinFIM.NET Information
WinFIM.NET - File Integrity Monitoring For Windows

<b>#Introduction</b>
There are plenty of commercial tools to do file integrity monitoring (FIM). But, for freeware / Open Source, especially for Windows, it seems not much options.

A small Windows Service named [“WinFIM.NET”](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-winfim.net/tree/master/WinFIM.NET) was developed trying to fill up this gap.
